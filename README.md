## What is the current problem?

  When someone comes to a hospital with symptoms of Covid-19 and/or Pneumonia it is vital that they get a timely and accurate diagnosis. A Covid-19 diagnosis requires either a saliva test, or a nasopharyngeal culture test, and Covid-19 Pneumonia requires an additional radiograph. For those with symptoms of Covid-19 Pneumonia, that prolonged time can affect treatment outcomes and the overall health of the patient. This time is crucial for those who are admitted in critical condition and need immediate care. 

## What is the goal of this project?

  The goal of this project is to create a machine learning algorithm that can detect and differentiate Covid-19 Pneumonia, versus bacterial pneumonia, versus a healthy patient through radiographs like the images above. This would provide a one-step diagnostic tool to diagnose Covid pneumonia, and eliminate the two step process of a PCR test followed by a chest radiograph. These two-steps would be consolidated into one radiograph detected by machine learning. It also dictates having the accuracy comparable to current FDA-approved Covid-19 testing[3] and radiological experts. It is expected that after training the algorithm will have a test accuracy of around 94%. Limited prior institutional research has been done with the novelty of the virus.

## Methods and Procedures
### Designing the AI

  To optimize the accuracy of the model, over 10,000 training images were pather through a deep convolutional neural network.
